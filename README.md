# Pathwise

Pathwise is a career-planning agent that simulates counterfactual career paths—rooted in real data, transparent about uncertainty, and tailored to each user’s skill profile, constraints, and goals.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Pathwise helps individuals navigate their career decisions with data-driven insights.
It answers four key questions:

* **Show me the path.** Trace a route from current skills to potential roles, with salary and impact forecasts over 1–5 years.
* **Compare choices.** Evaluate options side-by-side (bootcamp vs. CS minor, internal transfer vs. new company, MBA vs. staying).
* **Tell me why.** Surface evidence and similar profiles (“people like me who did X ended up in Y”), with citations.
* **Make it doable.** Generate a concrete study and work plan with courses, projects, networking moves, and timelines.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Profile & Constraints Intake**
   Collects skills, experience, interests, geography, visa status, time budget, financial runway, and risk tolerance.

2. **Outcome Model (Counterfactuals)**
   Projects earnings, seniority, job-offer likelihood, promotion timing, happiness proxies, and risk bands.

3. **Intervention Planner**
   Recommends a sequence of actions—courses, projects, certifications, internships, conferences—with effort estimates.

4. **Evidence Retrieval (TiDB + Vector Search + RAG)**

   * **Storage & Indexing:** TiDB Cloud indexes ESCO skills data, anonymized career trajectories, job descriptions, salary surveys, and alumni stories.
   * **Retrieval:** Vector search finds similar profiles/resources. RAG pipelines ground LLM outputs in retrieved documents.

5. **Explainable Trade-offs**
   Highlights which actions most influence outcomes (e.g., “an open-source data-viz project improves interview rates more than a generic SQL cert”).

## 🌟 Standout Product Moments

* **Path Explorer** – Interactive graph: current skills → bridge skills → target roles, with confidence bands.
* **Decision Duel** – Compare 2–3 strategies with projected offer timing, comp, 3-year ceiling, and burnout risk.
* **Week-by-Week Plan** – Adaptive 12-week schedule respecting time and money constraints, with auto-adjustments.
* **“People Like Me” Receipts** – Real anonymized trajectories from similar professionals, pulled via vector search.

## 🛠️ Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+
* MySQL or TiDB instance
* API keys for Google Gemini and SerpAPI

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file with at least:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:pass@host:port/db"
AUTH_SECRET="dev_secret_change_me"

## 🔄 Data Flow & Integrations

* **User Profile & Auth** – Register/login → signed JWT cookie. Skills/profile stored in MySQL/TiDB via Prisma.
* **Path Explorer** – `/api/path` pulls skills/resume → predicts target roles (vector search + Gemini) → fetches role requirements & resources via SerpAPI → results saved to session.
* **Decision Duel & Trade-offs** – LLM compares strategies, highlights efficient skill investments, merges evidence, saves to session.
* **People Like Me** – Vector similarity on anonymized people table; Gemini may summarize surfaced profiles.
* **Week Plan** – Builds a 12-week schedule from Path Explorer outputs; Gemini fills task details into structured JSON.
* **Chat** – LangChain graph ties Gemini to callable tools (path, duel, tradeoffs, people, week plan) for grounded responses.

### External Services

* **LLM & APIs:** Google Gemini (`@google/genai`), SerpAPI
* **Auth & Scheduling (optional):** Google OAuth/Calendar
* **Database & ORM:** TiDB/MySQL + Prisma
* **Orchestration:** LangChain
